            <h3>UB Hackathon</h3>
            <p>This projects was created for UB hackathon 2021.</p>
            <p>ChanceMe AI takes in all key indicators of your academic performance as well as the colleges you are
                interested in applying to, and produces a realistic result of your likelihood of acceptance. More
                precisely, it takes in numerical scores and analyzes the r/chanceme subreddit to judge the appeal of
                your extracurricular activities. It processes this data and returns a final percentage score of your
                likelihood of acceptance. Rating extracurricular activities is possible through a natural language
                processing model that computes a numerical sentiment value for a particular phrase.

            <h3>Genetic Evolution of a Species</h3>
            <p>This program simulates the process of natural selection in a simplified environment. Agents compete
                against each other for food in order to survive and reproduce. They can mutate and evolve their speed,
                turning strength, and view range in order to adapt. The simulation demonstrates that over time, in a
                competitive environment, the overall fitness of the agents increases.

        <div>
            <h3>Complex Evolution Simulation</h3>
            <p>A more complex simulation of evolution. In this simulation, agents are made of different structural parts
                that determine the function of the agents. The agents compete against each other in a battle
                royale-esque arena where the victors are used for reproduction (similar to a genetic algorithm). The DNA
                sequences of the bots determine their structure (similar to how amino acid sequences determine protein
                structure) and are crossed over/mutated during reproduction to allow the gradual evolution of the bots
                over time.

        <div>
            <h3>Viral Spread in a Metropolitan Area</h3>
            <p>An extremely simplified simulation of how a virus could spread in a metropolitan area. Agents follow a
                day-night cycle schedule and roam from location to location during the day before returning home. The
                program graphs the spread of the virus over time to see how different factors such as infectivity or
                fatality affect the spread. In response to the Covid-19 pandemic.

        <div>
            <h3>Voronoi Diagram Generator</h3>
            <p>A visualization of Voronoi diagrams in different metric spaces. The program calculates the distance of a
                pixel to each of the nodes making up the Voronoi diagram using a chosen distance metric. Euclidean
                distance is the direct length of a line segment between two points. Manhattan distance is the sum of the
                absolute difference of the cartesian coordinates of two points. Minkowski distance is the distance
                between two points in the normed vector space.
